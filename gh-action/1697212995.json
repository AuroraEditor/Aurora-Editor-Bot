Summary\r\n\r\nAdded support for allowing users to update the editor, enabling them to make changes and enhancements to the editor functionality.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n\r\n- Added a new application to the project that handles the updating of the editor.\r\n- Made changes to the UI of the update preference screen and its respective components.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- Notify users of new updates that are available (will be implemented when the [Notifications PR](#497) is done).\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this pull request is to enhance the functionality of the project by adding an update system. This feature is essential because we want to avoid being locked in by third-party software we don't have full control of or any proper understanding of.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI have conducted thorough testing to ensure the reliability and robustness of this feature.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/GIFs\r\n\r\nWill add them when done.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all of the following are completed before submitting the PR:\r\n\r\n- [X] Code has been tested and verified.\r\n- [X] Documentation has been updated to reflect the changes.\r\n- [ ] All tests pass successfully.\r\n- [X] Code follows the project's coding guidelines and style.\r\n- [X] The branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from the main branch.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are issues; I just can't find them at this moment.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\nNone","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AuroraEditor/AuroraEditor/issues/542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AuroraEditor/AuroraEditor/issues/542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AuroraEditor/AuroraEditor/issues/comments/1761751143","html_url":"https://github.com/AuroraEditor/AuroraEditor/pull/542#issuecomment-1761751143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AuroraEditor/AuroraEditor/issues/542","id":1761751143,"node_id":"IC_kwDOHlgR-c5pAjBn","user":{"login":"0xWDG","id":1290461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTA0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1290461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xWDG","html_url":"https://github.com/0xWDG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xWDG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xWDG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xWDG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xWDG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xWDG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xWDG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xWDG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xWDG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xWDG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-13T16:00:32Z","updated_at":"2023-10-13T16:00:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@aurora-editor-bot
