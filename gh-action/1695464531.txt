                    [message] => Fix GitHub login texts, login view window closing, sc-account id generation (#520)

## Summary

- fix the login view texts for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise accounts
(the localizations were switched around)
- fix the login view windows closing then logged successfully
- improve the id generation for source control accounts by not only
using the username but also a provider-specific string, so the same
usernames at different providers don't count as identical accounts

## Changes Made

See above.

## TODO

None.

## Motivation

Fix the explained bugs.

## Testing

- looking at the localizations
- validating the views close when logging in with GitHub & GitLab
- adding multiple accounts at once with the same username (GitHub &
GitLab)

GitHub login texts, login view window closing, sc-account id generation (#520)\n\n## Summary\r\n\r\n- fix the login view texts for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise accounts\r\n(the localizations were switched around)\r\n- fix the login view windows closing then logged successfully\r\n- improve the id generation for source control accounts by not only\r\nusing the username but also a provider-specific string, so the same\r\nusernames at different providers don't count as identical accounts\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nFix the explained bugs.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- looking at the localizations\r\n- validating the views close when logging in with GitHub & GitLab\r\n- adding multiple accounts at once with the same username (GitHub &\r\nGitLab)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/GIFs\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all of the following are completed before submitting the\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n- [X]
