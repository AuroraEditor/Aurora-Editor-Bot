                    [body] => ## Summary

- fix the login view texts for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise accounts (the localizations were switched around)
- fix the login view windows closing then logged successfully
- improve the id generation for source control accounts by not only using the username but also a provider-specific string, so the same usernames at different providers don't count as identical accounts

## Changes Made

See above.

## TODO

None.

## Motivation

Fix the explained bugs.

## Testing

- looking at the localizations
- validating the views close when logging in with GitHub & GitLab
- adding multiple accounts at once with the same username (GitHub & GitLab)

                            [commit_message] => ## Summary

- fix the login view texts for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise accounts
(the localizations were switched around)
- fix the login view windows closing then logged successfully
- improve the id generation for source control accounts by not only
using the username but also a provider-specific string, so the same
usernames at different providers don't count as identical accounts

## Changes Made

See above.

## TODO

None.

## Motivation

Fix the explained bugs.

## Testing

- looking at the localizations
- validating the views close when logging in with GitHub & GitLab
- adding multiple accounts at once with the same username (GitHub &
GitLab)

Motivation\r\n\r\nFix the explained bugs.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- looking at the localizations\r\n- validating the views close when logging in with GitHub & GitLab\r\n- adding multiple accounts at once with the same username (GitHub &\r\nGitLab)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/GIFs\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all of the following are completed before submitting the\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n- [X]
